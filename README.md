## Overview
This landing page was built with just HTML and CSS. I incorporated some Semantic HTML into the landing page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- This page looked simple enough, but for some reasons my CSS developed a mind of its own, took some time before i could it work. It still needs some work though.

### Continued development

-I will focus on bulding projects from Frontend Mentor challenges and personal projects for personal development.
